Since this course is so rooted in community, it’s only fitting we try to provide as many resources as we can. But your greatest resource will be, in fact, each other.

<br />

### The BA Lab (McGill 127)
Missoula-based students are welcome (and encouraged) to utilize the BA Lab located on the University of Montana main campus. Staffed by graduate candidates and open to all takers of this course, the BA Lab is a one-to-one hands-on resource where you can get help, feedback, or critique before turning assignments in.
