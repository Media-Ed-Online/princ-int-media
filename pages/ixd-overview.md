This course is all about **interaction**, or how respond, develop, and communicate with the world around us. We do this a number of ways in the arts; through our devices, through our collaborators, and through the iterative processes behind designing and producing our products.

We'll begin the course looking at these core principles, particularly in reference to web design and web practices.
