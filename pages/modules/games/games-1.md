As you get through our next and final lab, it'll become clearer how games are _interactive experiences_ and the newest media that utilizes creative communication to tell stories between creater, user, and device.

Games have come a long way in a very short time, and are still learning how to use IxD and UxD practices to create working environments that immerse players in artifical worlds. Over the last handful of "Group Think" forums we'll explore some of the elements of game design that accomplish this, utilizing a game you select from the options below.

</div>

Since we'll be discussing the "language of games," it's only fair we become aquainted with some of its terminology.


#### What is a Game?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPqR2wOs8WI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>


#### What is a Game Engine?

A **game engine** is basically a software development kit on which to build games. Games can be built without using a engine, but having access to pre-developed toolkits, libraries, and scripts can greatly ease and speed-up the creation process. Consider travelling from Point A to Poit B. You can get there by walking, but it's faster and more efficient to drive - although more costly.


#### What is a Game Genre?

Just like with film and literature, video games are categorized by **genre**. Unlike film and literature genres, however, game genres detail a game's type of challenge, rather than its contents. There are umbrella genres like "action" and specific sub-genres, like "shooter" or "survival."

For example, you can have fantasy, adventure, or role-playing games that have completely different goals, but can all be categorized as platformers. A **platformer** (either 2D or 3D) is, at its core, a game where players must jump over suspended platforms or obstacles to complete challenges.

Many early video games were platformers, such as _Super Mario Bros._ (1985) and _Sonic the Hedgehog_ (1991). This genre has made a large resurgance since game engines have become widely available, due to its lower-learning curve and tried-and-true mechanics.

<div style="display: block; width: 400px; margin: auto;">
  <img src="./img/mario-blocks.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 50px; border: 0; width: 200px;" />

  <p class="img-caption"><b>Blocks</b> are foundational in the <cite>Mario</cite> series, which can be used as platforms to traverse the area, or destroyed for potential benefits or points.</p>
</div>

Since you're building a platformer in Unity, you should take some time to see what this engine (and this genre) is capable of, and what [professionals are making](https://unity3d.com/showcase/gallery/?platform=&genre=917&gametype=t-2d#gamesstart)! Please select **one** of the games below, and play it over the course of the _Games_ module. You will be expected to share your expoloration of design through playing this game in your upcoming "Group Think" discussions.

**NOTE:** You can purchase these games for any device or platform, from any service. Steam is just a suggestion (for Mac and PC users without consoles).

#### Platformer Sub-Grene: Metroidvania

The **Metroidvania** sub-genre includes 2D platformers which follow the design structure pioneered by the  _Metroid_ and _Castlevania_ titles.

Video games in this model have an emphasis on exploratory structure, but access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be passed once the player has acquired special items, tools, weapons or abilities within the game.

#### Platformer Sub-Genre: Run 'n' Gun
The **run-and-gun** (or run 'n' gun) sub-genre includes video games in which the player generally controls a lone gunman as they travel on foot through levels defeating enemies.

Run-and-gun games are often defined as a mix between platformers and shoot 'em ups, are generally side-scrollers, and are notable for often featuring enjoyable co-operative gameplay.

<p style="color: #E9475E">
  <i><b>NOTE:</b></i> This area is now reserved for those interested in learning more about game design. You do not have to go through these materials, although I highly encourage it!
</p>

Game design is a huge field. Professional development can take years, and there are entire schools and majors dedicated to _specific_ areas of game development, much less "the whole process."

We may be small, but we're glad to offer you additional (and excellent) places to go if you're interested in learning more.

#### Character Scripts
Note that you can download the scripts so you won't have to write any code yourself.

#### Creating Your Own Custom Characters
You can make your own sprite sheets, or find one online. There are countless ones available, including classic game characters like Zelda and Sonic!
